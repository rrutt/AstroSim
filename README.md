# Astronomical Simulation

## The Software

"Astronomical Simulation" is an open source n-body gravitational simulation.

The software is a self-contained executable program, written in **[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)**, that runs on Microsoft Windows.
(No separate run-time environment is required to run the program.)
The **[Lazarus Integrated Development Environment](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)** was used to develop the Horse Race Game.
(Both Free Pascal and the Lazarus IDE are free open-source software products.) 

## Running the Program

You can run the Astronomical Simulation program on Microsoft Windows as follows:

- Download the **AstroSim.exe** binary executable file from the **bin** sub-folder from this GitHub.com page.
- Double-click the downloaded copy of **AstroSim.exe**

## Using the Program

When the program starts it displays the **Astronomical Simulationn** Main Form.

The Main Form contains these elements:
